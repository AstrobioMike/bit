## input reads directory (can be relative to workflow directory, or needs to be full path)
input_reads_dir:
    "example-metagenomic-reads/"

## if data are single-end only (only one read-file per sample), set this to "TRUE", anything else is considered paired-end
single_end_data:

## root directory of reference databases (or where they will be downloaded if they don't exist yet)
    # this should be provided as a full path (starting with `/`) and include the ending `/` as in the
    # below example (note that the the `~/` home shortcut is not expanded

## maximum memory allowed passed to megahit assembler
    # can be set either by proportion of available on system, e.g. 0.5
    # or by absolute value in bytes, e.g. 100e9 would be 100 GB
max_mem_megahit:

## Block size variable for CAT/diamond, lower value means less RAM usage; see https://github.com/bbuchfink/diamond/wiki/3.-Command-line-options#memory--performance-options

## setting for trimming recommended when working with Swift 1S libraries
    # adds `swift=t` setting to bbduk quality trimming/filtering command

## memory used by bbmap's pileup.sh (within the get_cov_and_det rule)
# passed as the -Xmx parameter, 20g means 20 gigs of RAM, 20m means 20 megabytes
# 5g should be sufficient for most assemblies, but if that rule is failing, this may need to be increased

##### Resource specifications that may need to be changed (mostly only necessary if using a job scheduler) #####
####### Could leave these as-is to start, but they are here to be increased if a job fails due to memory #######
################################################################################################################

### these are all passed in the "resources" directive of their respective rules in the Snakefile, going to
    # the "mem_mb" argument (so should be provided in terms of megabytes)

# passed to megahit in the assembly_PE and assembly_SE rules
    # this should match what is passed to "max_mem_megahit" above, though it needs to be written differently
    # this is passed as "mem_mb", so 100000 would be equal to the default 100e9 set above for "max_mem_megahit"
megahit_memory_resources:
    100000

# passed to pileup.sh within the get_cov_and_det rule
    # should match what is passed to "pileup_mem" above, though needs to be written differently
    # this is passed as "mem_mb", e.g., 5g above, for 5 gigabytes, would be 5000 megabytes, so we need to set this variable to 5000
pileup_memory_resources:
    5000

# passed to mapping_SE and mapping_PE rules, passed as "mem_mb", so 25000 here means 25 gigabytes of memory will be allocated by the scheduler
mapping_memory_resources:
    25000

# passed to rule gtdbtk_on_MAGs
gtdbtk_memory_resources:

################# REFERENCE DATABASES #################
#######################################################
# The below variables probably shouldn't be changed unless we really want to for some reason.
# The workflow will check the location pointed to above for the below databases, and install them
# if they are not already there. It looks for the below "TRIGGER" filenames (they 
# all end with "*_DB_SETUP") in the directory for each database, which it creates when
# it sets them up initially. If we want to point to DBs that already exist on our setup,
# we need to add these (empty) files to their respective directories. The
# workflow just checks the file is there to know it doesn't need to setup the DB.
#
# All together, after installed and unpacked, these will take up about 240 GB. But may 
# require up to 500 GB during installation and initial un-packing.

## example usage command ##
# snakemake --use-conda --conda-prefix ${CONDA_PREFIX}/envs -j 2 -p

# `--use-conda` – this specifies to use the conda environments included in the workflow
# `--conda-prefix` – this allows us to point to where the needed conda environments should be stored. Including this means if we use the workflow on a different dataset somewhere else in the future, it will re-use the same conda environments rather than make new ones. The value listed here, `${CONDA_PREFIX}/envs`, is the default location for conda environments (the variable `${CONDA_PREFIX}` will be expanded to the appropriate location on whichever system it is run on).
# `-j` – this lets us set how many jobs Snakemake should run concurrently (keep in mind that many of the thread and cpu parameters set in the config.yaml file will be multiplied by this)
# `-p` – specifies to print out each command being run to the screen

# See `snakemake -h` for more options and details.
